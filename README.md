# Cryptosi.Crypto
IPFS hosted, 'unstoppable' CryptoSI website

This website will be built entirely through @gitcoin bounties, as a way for us to start testing out the features and familiarise ourselves with the processes on that platform.

We are aiming to have a React or similar technology based website, hosted on IPFS and demonstrating information about Crypto SI which is similar to the information currently held on CryptoSI.com

This Readme will be further updated as this process is continued.
